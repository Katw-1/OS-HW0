Part 2 Design:

I created a struct called Stack. In defining the Stack, I created an integer
slice called data. Two method are created to add and remove elements from the stack, 
Push and Pop respectively. 

Push method appends the value that was in the parameter in to the Stack that 
was being ponted.

Pop() method has more to it. The Stack that is being referred to by the method simply
removes the last element by reassigning the numbers of elements in the stack exculding 
the last element, thus removing the final element.

In the main function, I do two four loops that iterate 100 times. The first one is
adding values starting from 0 to 100 into the stack while simultaneously display 
the value that was inputted to the Stack.The second one uses Pop() to remove elements 
one by one until stack is empty.
